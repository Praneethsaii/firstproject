    <h1 id="series-overview">Series Overview</h1>
    <p>One Piece (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese anime television series produced by Toei Animation that premiered on Fuji Television in October 1999. It is based on Eiichiro Oda's manga series of the same name. The story follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body gained the properties of rubber after unintentionally eating a Devil Fruit. With his crew, named the Straw Hat Pirates, Luffy explores the Grand Line in search of the world's ultimate treasure known as the "One Piece" in order to become the next King of the Pirates.

        Since its premiere in Japan more than 1,100 episodes have been aired, and later exported to various countries around the world.
    
        On October 13, 2024, it was announced that the series' Egghead story arc would enter on a six-month hiatus and is set to resume in April 2025, having a new timeslot on Fuji TV. The One Piece Fan Letter special took the time slot on October 20, which will be followed by a 21-episode special edited version of the Fishman Island story arc, titled One Piece Log: Fish-Man Island Saga. This version will feature reshot scenes, retouched art, detailing, color shading, lighting, and special effects to previously animated scenes, and a Dolby Atmos soundtrack.[4] Originally scheduled to premiere on October 27, 2024, the premiere date was moved to November 3, due to Fuji TV's coverage of the 2024 World Series.
    
        One Piece (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda. It has been serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since July 1997, with its chapters compiled in 110 tankōbon volumes as of November 2024. The series follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy and his crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, as he explores the Grand Line in search of the mythical treasure known as the "One Piece" to become the next King of the Pirates.

        The manga spawned a media franchise, having been adapted into a festival film by Production I.G, and an anime series by Toei Animation, which began broadcasting in 1999. Additionally, Toei has developed fourteen animated feature films, one original video animation, and thirteen television specials. Several companies have developed various types of merchandising and media, such as a trading card game and numerous video games. The manga series was licensed for an English language release in North America and the United Kingdom by Viz Media and in Australia by Madman Entertainment. The anime series was licensed by 4Kids Entertainment for an English-language release in North America in 2004 before the license was dropped and subsequently acquired by Funimation in 2007. Netflix released a live action TV series adaptation in 2023.
        
        One Piece has received praise for its storytelling, world-building, art, characterization, and humour. It has received many awards and is ranked by critics, reviewers, and readers as one of the best manga of all time. By August 2022, it had over 516.6 million copies in circulation in 61 countries and regions worldwide, making it the best-selling manga series in history, and the best-selling comic series printed in a book volume. Several volumes of the manga have broken publishing records, including the highest initial print run of any book in Japan. In 2015 and 2022, One Piece set the Guinness World Record for "the most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author". It was the best-selling manga for eleven consecutive years from 2008 to 2018 and is the only manga that had an initial print of volumes of above 3 million continuously for more than 10 years, as well as the only one that had achieved more than 1 million copies sold in all of its over 100 published tankōbon volumes. One Piece is the only manga whose volumes have ranked first every year in Oricon's weekly comic chart existence since 2008.</p>
    <h1 id="characters">Characters</h1>
    <p>The protagonists of the One Piece series are all the members of the Straw Hat Pirates (麦わらの一味, Mugiwara no Ichimi), a crew of ten pirates captained by Monkey D. Luffy. The crew's number increases throughout the series, as Luffy recruits new members. Once Usopp joins the Straw Hat Pirates, they gain their own ship, the Going Merry, which is later destroyed and replaced by a larger and more powerful vessel, the Thousand Sunny created by their shipwright Franky. Two years later, the Straw Hats gain a new fleet, called the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, consisting of 5,640 pirates from seven different crews; Luffy objects to the idea of being a fleet commander, and organizes his new army in a way that they may act independently, but when one crew is in trouble, the others must do what they can to help them. By the end of the Wano Country Arc, the Straw Hat Pirates are recognized as an Emperor-led crew with Luffy also being recognized as the leader of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet[ch. 903] and the other nine members as its Senior Officers[ch. 1058] after the defeat of both Kaido and Big Mom.

        Main article: Monkey D. Luffy
        Monkey D. Luffy (モンキー・D・ルフィ, Monkī Dī Rufi) is the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates and the main protagonist of the One Piece series. At age seven, he admires and tries to join the pirates of the "Red Haired" Shanks. Ridiculed and rejected, he inadvertently eats their treasure, the Paramecia-type Gum-Gum Fruit (ゴムゴムの実, Gomu Gomu no Mi), which gives him rubbery attributes. His reckless efforts ultimately lead him into grave peril causing Shanks to lose an arm while rescuing him. After this, Luffy gives up on joining Shanks, resolving instead to start a crew of his own and become King of the Pirates.[ch. 1] Displeased by Shanks spoiling his grandson, Garp takes Luffy to be raised by Curly Dadan and her mountain bandits, who he strong-arms into taking him in. During Luffy's time there, he becomes a sworn brother with Ace, Garp's other ward, and Sabo, a local runaway noble.[ch. 582–589]
        
        Ten years later and still wearing Shanks' treasured straw hat, Luffy forms and commands his own pirate crew called The Straw Hat Pirates and sets sail for the Grand Line, quickly gaining infamy as "Straw Hat" Luffy (麦わらのルフィ, Mugiwara no Rufi).[ch. 2, 7, 96, 98] Eventually, after his strength proves insufficient to save Ace from execution, he spends two years on a secluded island, learning the use of the three colors of Haki as well as his rubber ability's fourth Gear from Silvers Rayleigh, before heading to the New World.[ch. 590–602] Due to his infamy, he is one of the pirates who are known as "The Worst Generation". After the defeat of Kaido and Big Mom, he is subsequently named one of the newest members of the Four Emperors. Luffy is also capable of using the advanced application for all types of Haki. During his fight with Kaido, his devil fruit power awakened, revealing its true nature as the Mythical Zoan-type, Human-Human Fruit, Model: Nika.

        Eventually, he comes into conflict with Helmeppo, the spoiled son of a navy officer. To prevent the harm of innocent civilians, Zoro allows himself to be incarcerated temporarily, while Helmeppo plots to have him killed. Zoro is saved from execution by Luffy in exchange for becoming his first crewman. At that point, Zoro makes it clear that he would turn on his captain if he ever stepped between him and his dream.[ch. 2–6] However, Zoro grows fond of his crew and after several defeats in their defense, his priorities change and he convinces Mihawk to take him on as a student.[ch. 51f., 485, 597] Zoro is capable of utilizing all three types of Haki and is capable of using the advanced application for both Haoshoku and Busoshoku Haki. He is known for his awful sense of direction and constantly gets lost when traveling.

        Main article: Nami (One Piece)
        Adopted and raised by navy seaman turned tangerine farmer Belle-Mère, Nami (ナミ) witnessed her mother being murdered by the infamous Arlong, whose pirate gang occupies their island and extracts tribute from the population. Striking a deal with him, Nami, still a child, but already an accomplished cartographer who dreams of drawing a complete map of the world, joins the pirates, hoping to buy freedom for her village eventually. Growing up as a pirate-hating pirate drawing maps for Arlong and stealing treasure from other pirates, Nami becomes an excellent burglar, pickpocket, and navigator with an exceptional ability to forecast weather.[ch. 77, 95, 130] After Arlong betrays her, and he and his gang are defeated by the Straw Hat Pirates, Nami joins them in pursuit of her dream and acquires infamy herself as "Cat Burglar" Nami (泥棒猫のナミ, Dorobō Neko no Nami).[ch. 94f., 435]

        <h2>Usopp</h2>
        <img src="https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp1872449.png" alt="">
        Main article: Usopp
        During his early childhood, Usopp (ウソップ, Usoppu) was abandoned by his father, Yasopp, who left to join the Red-Haired Pirates. As his mother, Bachina, falls ill, Usopp starts telling tall tales, expressing his hope that his father will return and take them out to sea. He regularly goes to the mansion at the top of the hill where he lives, to visit Kaya. Even after his mother dies, Usopp does not blame his father for leaving. Despite his cowardly disposition, he strives to become a great pirate.[ch. 25, 41]
        
        Usopp is recognizable for his long nose, a reference to the fact that he tends to lie a lot. He is a gifted inventor, painter, and sculptor.[ch. 42, 106, 190] In combat, he relies primarily on slingshots to fire various kinds of ammunition with great precision in coordination with a set of lies and other weapons giving him a unique fighting style named "The Usopp Arsenal".[ch. 332] To help the Straw Hats rescue Nico Robin, he achieves notoriety under his alter-ego "Sogeking, the King of Snipers" (狙撃の王様そげキング, Sogeki no Ō-sama Sogekingu), a hero sniper wearing a golden mask and cape. Eventually, after helping the Straw Hats liberate Dressrosa from Donquixote Doflamingo's rule, he becomes infamous as "God" Usopp (ゴッド ウソップ, Goddo Usoppu).[ch. 435]

        <img src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.Re7p66eKaxAiX9TTFJVc-wHaEK&pid=Api&P=0&h=180" alt="">
        Main article: Sanji (One Piece)
        Born as a prince of Germa Kingdom, Vinsmoke Sanji (ヴィンスモーク・サンジ, Vinsumōku Sanji) is routinely ridiculed by his genetically enhanced siblings and is locked away by his father Judge for being a disgrace. With help from his sister Reiju, he escapes and flees Germa, a floating kingdom composed of several ships, after it enters the East Blue and his father permits it.
        
        While serving as an apprentice cook on a passenger ship, nine-year-old Sanji stands up to a boarding party of pirates led by the infamous "Red Foot" Zeff. During the encounter, Sanji is swept into the sea by a massive wave. Zeff jumps in after him because of their common dream of finding the All Blue (オールブルー, Ōru Burū), a legendary area where the East, West, North, and South Blue seas meet, containing every kind of fish in the world. While castaways together, the pirate saves Sanji's life yet again by giving him all of their food. After their eventual rescue, Sanji stays with Zeff for several years and helps him build a floating restaurant, the Baratie (バラティエ). Zeff in turn makes him a first-rate cook and teaches him his kick-based fighting style.[ch. 56–59] Mirroring Zeff, Sanji will never refuse a starving person a meal, and he uses only his legs when fighting to protect the hands he needs for cooking.[ch. 48, 370] He has a weakness for women and makes it a principle never to harm one, even if it means his death.[ch. 403]
        
        Eventually, he becomes infamous as "Black Leg" Sanji (黒脚のサンジ, Kuro Ashi no Sanji).[ch. 435] While training for a period of two years in Emporio Ivankov's Kamabakka Queendom (カマバッカ王国, Kamabakka Ōkoku), he develops the Sky Walk (空中歩行スカイ・ウォーク, Sukai Wōku), a variant of the Six Powers (六式, Rokushiki) technique Moonwalk (月歩, Geppo), which allows him to essentially run through air.[ch. 635] Sanji receives his own Raid Suit from his family that grants him the ability to turn invisible[ch. 903], though he later destroys it out of fear of losing his humanity.[ch. 1031]
        
        Sanji's standard appearance is wearing a well-fitting black suit with a skinny black tie. His hair always covers one of his eyes and he is usually smoking a cigarette.
        
        In the anime television series, he is voiced by Hiroaki Hirata. In the 4Kids English adaptation, he is voiced by David Moo. In the Funimation English adaptation, his voice is supplied by Eric Vale.[3]
        
        Sanji is portrayed by Taz Skylar in the live-action adaptation of One Piece.

        
        <h2>Tony Tony Chopper</h2>
        <img src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.F8EmM0eBE_e08drFsDAZowHaF7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180" alt="">
        Main article: Tony Tony Chopper
        Tony Tony Chopper (トニートニー・チョッパー, Tonī Tonī Choppā) is an anthropomorphic reindeer and doctor. The power of the Zoan-type Human-Human Fruit (ヒトヒトの実, Hito Hito no Mi) provides him with the ability to transform into a full-sized reindeer or a reindeer-human hybrid.[ch. 140] A self-developed drug he calls Rumble Ball (ランブル・ボール, Ranburu Bōru) enables him to perform even more transformations for three minutes.[ch. 149] With help from Caesar Clown, Chopper can last in his transformations for about 30 minutes.[ch. 1014]
        
        Rejected by his herd because of his blue nose and eating the Devil Fruit, Chopper is rescued by Drum Island's quack doctor Doctor Hiriluk. While developing a potion to create cherry blossoms when in contact with snow, Chopper is heartbroken when Hiriluk falls ill with a deadly disease. After Hiriluk's death, Doctor Kureha takes him in as his mentor. After the Straw Hats arrive at Drum Island and take Chopper with them, Kureha uses Hiriluk's potion to turn the snowy sky into cherry blossoms, fulfilling Hiriluk's life mission. When complimented, Chopper acts flustered and sometimes yells at the person who complimented him to stop trying to make him happy.[ch. 140] A running gag within the series is when other characters mistake him as a Tanuki, and he angrily corrects them, pointing out that he is a Tonakai (Japanese for "Reindeer").
        
        Chopper's voice actress is Ikue Ōtani.[11] Kazue Ikura voiced Tony Tony Chopper for episodes 254–263.[12] Brina Palencia voices Chopper in the English Funimation dub.
        
        When creating Chopper, Oda wanted a mascot who is both cute and feeble.[13] An IGN review of the manga praised Chopper's character as one of the best in the series and said that he was able to be both touching and funny.[14] With Chopper's backstory, Oda wanted to illustrate that one need not be blood-related to be considered family.[15]
        
        <h2>Nico Robin</h2>
        <img src="https://cdn.oneesports.id/cdn-data/sites/2/2022/04/One-Piece-Nico-Robin.jpg" alt="">

Poneglyphs), which are scattered around the world. She comes to share their goal of finding the elusive Real Ponegliff (真の歴史の本文リオ・ポーネグリフ, Rio Pōnegurifu), which is said to tell the world's lost history referred to as the 100-Year Void (空白の100年, Kūhaku no Hyaku-nen, Void Century).[ch. 218] However, the World Government finds out about these efforts and sends a battlefleet to stop them. Only Robin escapes the devastating attack that claims the lives of the island's entire population, including that of her mother.[ch. 218, 395]
        
        Called "Devil Child" (悪魔の子, Akuma no Ko), traumatized, and with a bounty on her head, Robin lives a life on the run, unable to trust anyone.[ch. 218] To survive, she cooperates with various pirates and other outlaws. She eventually joins Sir Crocodile's Baroque Works group, using the codename "Ms. All-Sunday" (ミス・オールサンデー, Misu Ōrusandē)[ch. 398] and becomes their vice-president.[ch. 218] After Baroque Works falls apart, with nowhere else to go, she tags along with the Straw Hat Pirates[ch. 218] and grows so fond of them that she gives herself up to the Government to save them. After they discover her real reason for leaving, the Straw Hat Pirates declare open war against the Government to get her back. She realizes that she has finally found people who will never betray her and joins the crew.[ch. 398] Two years later, Robin further hones her Devil Fruit powers to the point she can create a full-bodied duplicate of herself.
        
        In the anime television series adaptation of the manga, Robin's voice actress is Yuriko Yamaguchi. In the 4Kids English adaptation, her Baroque Works codename was changed to Miss Sunday and she is voiced by Veronica Taylor.[17] In the Funimation English adaptation, she is voiced by Stephanie Young.[18]

        Main article: Franky (One Piece)
        The son of pirate parents who abandoned him at age nine, Cutty Flam (カティ・フラム, Kati Furamu) changed his name to Franky (フランキー, Furankī) and is taken in as an apprentice by shipwright Tom, who built Pirate King Gol D Roger's ship, the Oro Jackson, and also secretly holds the plans for a devastating ancient weapon.[ch. 344, 354, 427] Franky's recklessness eventually provides an opportunity for World Government agents seeking these plans.[ch. 356] Attempting to rescue his master, Franky suffers severe injuries and only survives by rebuilding parts of his body using pieces of scrap metal, turning himself into a cola-powered cyborg with strength.[ch. 336, 339, 352, 357f.] After gaining notoriety as "Cyborg" Franky (サイボーグ フランキー, Saibōgu Furankī), and to fulfill his dream of sailing a ship he built around the world, he constructs the Thousand Sunny, a brigantine-rigged sloop-of-war, for the Straw Hat Pirates and joins the crew.[ch. 435–437]

        Already a pirate before the time of Roger, "Humming" Brook (ブルック, Burukku) first enters the Grand Line as a member of the music-themed Rumbar Pirates. Leaving his pet, the infant whale Laboon (ラブーン, Rabūn), at Reverse Mountain, he promises to return after sailing around the world.[ch. 487] After losing his captain "Calico" Yorki (キャラコのヨーキ, Kyarako no Yōki), Brook took over the crew as the new captain. Some time later, he is annihilated, but the power of the Paramecia-type Revive-Revive Fruit (ヨミヨミの実, Yomi Yomi no Mi) allows him to resurrect as a skeleton.[ch. 443] Fifty years later, Brook's goal is still to fulfill his late crew's promise, and to that end he joins the Straw Hat Pirates.[ch. 459]
        
        He is an excellent musician, who says that he can play any instrument, although he is usually seen playing the violin.[ch. 486] Brook can even influence people with his music to the point of making them fall asleep.[ch. 454] While separated from the other Straw Hats, and incognito as "Soul King" Brook, he gains world fame, filling concert halls with fans.[ch. 600] He is also a skilled fencer who uses a shikomizue (a Japanese cane sword) in battle.[ch. 454] His reduced weight allows him to jump extraordinarily high and to run across water.[ch. 443, 493] Eventually, Brook learns how to use his Devil Fruit ability to leave his skeleton body and explore his surroundings as a disembodied soul.[ch. 629]

    <h1 id="production">Production</h1>
    <p>On June 8, 2004, 4Kids Entertainment acquired the license for distribution of One Piece in North America;[6] 4Kids contracted Viz Media to handle home video distribution. 4Kids' in-house musicians wrote a new background score and theme song nicknamed "Pirate Rap". 4Kids' dub mandated edits for content and length, which reduced the first 143 episodes into 104.[7] Initially, 4Kids originally created an English version of the first opening theme, "We Are!" by Russell Velazquez.[8] It premiered in the United States on September 18, 2004 on the Fox network as part of the weekend programming block FoxBox TV, and later aired on Cartoon Network on their Saturday night action programming block, Toonami in April 2005. It also aired in other blocks and line-ups, such as its Monday-Thursday night prime-time line-up and its Miguzi weekday after-school action block in 2006. Production was halted in 2006 after episode 143/104;[9][10] Viz also ceased its home video release of the series after volume 11. On July 22, 2010, an interview with Anime News Network and Mark Kirk, senior vice-president of digital media for 4Kids Entertainment, revealed that 4Kids acquired One Piece as part of a package deal with other anime, and that the company did not screen the series before licensing it. However, once 4Kids realized One Piece was not appropriate for their intended demographic, the company decided to edit it into a more child-oriented series until they had an opportunity to legally drop the license. Kirk said the experience of producing One Piece "ruined the company's reputation". Since then, 4Kids established a stricter set of guidelines, checks, and balances to determine which anime the company acquires.[11]

        On April 13, 2007, Funimation (now Crunchyroll, LLC) licensed the series and started production on an English-language release of One Piece[12] which also included redubbing the episodes previously dubbed by 4Kids.
